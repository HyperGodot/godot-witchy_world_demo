# Witch Island HyperGodot Example 

A simple prototype for a game-experience where witch creatures explore a summery island stuck forever pre-dawn until they solve the spell that keeps them there.  Future versions may include covens, chat, and mycology educational mini-games for people who don't normally consider themselves gamers.
